## Infos for developers

The core of TagSpaces starting from version 3 is built with [react.js](https://reactjs.org/) and the great [material-ui](https://mui.com/) framework.

The native Windows, Linux and Mac OS versions of TagSpaces are built with [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/). Electron is an app runtime based on Chromium and node.js. In order to combine it with react we have used the [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).

## How to run TagSpaces from the source code?

In order to run TagSpaces on your Windows, Mac OS or Linux from the source code published here, you will need the following prerequisites:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [git](http://git-scm.org/)

Get the TagSpaces source code by cloning its repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tagspaces/tagspaces.git

Go to the folder where the code was cloned to and select the branch you want to test. Use the **master** branch for the last officially released version or the branch **develop** for a kind of a nightly build, containing the changes we are preparing for the next release of the application.

Switch to the folder where you have cloned the repository:

    $ cd tagspaces

Change to the branch with the name **develop**:

    $ git checkout develop

and install the project dependencies:

    $ npm install

Starting from v4 of the application, a web service is running locally as a separate process. The web service is responsible for the search index creation and the generation of the thumbnails for most of the images formats. A key is required in order for the main application to communicate with the web server. It should be generated from webpack script in the `.env` file located in `release/app` folder. This is an example for an .env file.

    KEY=a_custom_key

Having a custom key, ensures that another instance of TagSpaces will not communicate with the web service of the initial instance, since it is always running on the same port.

Now you are ready and can build and start the application with:

    $ npm run build

    $ npm run start

If you want to try the development mode, you can start the app with:

    $ npm run dev

This will start a development server in background, which watches for changes in background and refreshes the application automatically once you have done some changes in the source code.

## Package for Windows, Linux and macOS

Building of the packages can be accomplished with the integrated npm scripts:

```bash
$ npm run package-win

$ npm run package-linux

$ npm run package-mac

$ npm run package-mac-arm64
```

The commands will create packages for Windows, Linux, Mac OS and Mac OS with the M1 processor respectively. Do not forget to run the `npm run build` script before packaging.

## Package the Android

Building of the packages for Android can be accomplished with the integrated npm scripts:

```bash
$ npm run version-meta

$ npm run prepare-cordova

$ npm run package-android
```

## Start the web version locally

For developing purposes and local tests, the web version of the app can be started with the following npm command:

    $ npm run run-web

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
npm run test-unit

npm run test-playwright

npm run test-playwright-web
```

## Developing viewer and editor for TagSpaces

TagSpaces can be easily extended with the help of extensions. Currently we use the extensions for supporting the opening and editing of different file types in the application. More information about this topic can be found on the [extension page](https://www.tagspaces.org/extensions/) of our website.

## Contribute

TagSpaces is an open source software, and as such, the code is publicly available on GitHub, and forking is particularly recommended! Still, contribution must be done following some guidelines.
Contributor License Agreement

The CLA is an agreement commonly used in major open source project, which aims at protecting all parties implied by a contribution: the contributor, the main code author, and above all, the community. The CLA model we have chosen basically tells the following: the contributionâ€™s copyright is shared between the contributor and the main author. This means each party can do whatever she want in term of relicensing with this contributed piece of code. This is important, because, if in the future, the author wants to change the license in something more in favor of the community, a singular contributor cannot block the process.

The Contributor License Agreement can be signed online on the following [CLA form](https://www.tagspaces.org/contribute/).
